    bidding working again, made the logic more robust. Still cant track down the issue with the rpizeros getting all the bids while the rpi2 and rpi3 are not getting some of the bids. There is no reason for this since all nodes are running same code and I ran the rpi2 and rpi3 on ethernet so its not a latency issue. So I have not thought of a logical reason for this.

    lots of UI work. React frontend now has dynamic table to display nodes. This table updates information every sec using socketio for realtime data. Bootstrap dynamic components. Send message into nodes works. No more ajax server side, all connections happen via socketio using web sockets. setState needs to happen outside of render, async. Finishing remove trust component.

    sending find nodes command to server working, server sends whois message into nodes network, nodes respond with info message containing their ip and a message. then server parses a list of json objects and from  those pulls out all the IPs of the nodes found and puts them into a list that is then returned to the frontend, all in realtime

    moved from AJAX to socketio web sockets. React frontend can now get realtime data from the nodes. It is working right now that React emits a message every second and the server responses with the mcast listener data that is it collecting from nodes. that data instantly moves from flask server to react frontend via socketio web sockets. React is updating in real time and interacting with server that interacts with nodes.
